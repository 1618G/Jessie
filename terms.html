                <p class="legal__updated">Last updated: 8 February 2026</p>

                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

                <p>By engaging our Services, whether through our website, email, telephone, or in person, you agree to be bound by these Terms. Please read them carefully before proceeding.</p>

                <h2>2. Services Offered</h2>

                <ul>

                </ul>
                <p>The precise scope of Services will be detailed in a written proposal or quotation provided before work commences.</p>

                <h2>3. Quotations &amp; Pricing</h2>
                <h3>3.1 Estimates</h3>
                <p>All quotations provided via our website calculator, email, or in-person consultation are indicative estimates only. A final, binding quotation will be provided in writing following a property assessment and agreement on the project scope.</p>
                <h3>3.2 Validity</h3>
                <p>Written quotations are valid for 30 days from the date of issue unless otherwise stated. After this period, we reserve the right to adjust pricing to reflect changes in supplier costs or material availability.</p>
                <h3>3.3 Additional Costs</h3>
                <p>Any work requested beyond the agreed scope will be quoted separately and must be approved in writing before commencement. This includes, but is not limited to, additional rooms, change of design direction, or additional supplier visits.</p>

                <h2>4. Payment Terms</h2>
                <h3>4.1 Deposit</h3>
                <p>A non-refundable deposit of 50% of the total project cost is required to secure your booking and commence work. No work will begin until the deposit has been received and cleared.</p>
                <h3>4.2 Balance</h3>
                <p>The remaining 50% balance is due upon completion of the project, prior to the final handover. For projects exceeding £5,000, staged payments may be arranged by mutual agreement.</p>
                <h3>4.3 Payment Methods</h3>
                <p>Payment may be made by bank transfer (BACS), or such other method as agreed in writing. All prices are quoted in Pounds Sterling (GBP) and are inclusive of VAT where applicable.</p>
                <h3>4.4 Late Payment</h3>
                <p>Invoices not paid within 14 days of the due date will incur a late payment charge of 3% per month on the outstanding balance. We reserve the right to suspend Services and withhold deliverables until full payment is received.</p>

                <h2>5. Booking &amp; Scheduling</h2>
                <h3>5.1 Confirmation</h3>
                <p>A booking is confirmed upon receipt of the signed proposal (or written acceptance via email) and the deposit payment. We will then schedule the project within our diary and provide estimated timelines.</p>
                <h3>5.2 Access</h3>
                <p>You must provide reasonable access to the property at agreed times. Failure to provide access may result in additional charges and project delays for which we cannot be held liable.</p>
                <h3>5.3 Express Delivery</h3>
                <p>Express delivery projects (5 working days or fewer) are subject to a 25% surcharge and availability. Express timelines are targets, not guarantees, and may be affected by supplier lead times beyond our control.</p>

                <h2>6. Cancellation &amp; Refunds</h2>
                <h3>6.1 Client Cancellation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Before work begins:</strong> If you cancel after paying the deposit but before work has commenced, the deposit is non-refundable. Any furniture or materials already ordered on your behalf are non-refundable and remain your responsibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>During the project:</strong> If you cancel mid-project, you will be invoiced for all work completed to date, materials ordered or purchased, and any third-party costs incurred.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>6.2 Our Cancellation</h3>
                <p>We reserve the right to cancel a project if the Client breaches these Terms, fails to make payments on time, or makes the working environment unsafe or unreasonable. In such cases, charges for completed work and incurred costs will apply.</p>
                <h3>6.3 Cooling Off</h3>
                <p>Where Services are contracted at a distance (online or by telephone), you have the right to cancel within 14 days of agreement under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013, provided that Services have not already commenced with your express consent.</p>

                <h2>7. Furniture &amp; Materials</h2>
                <h3>7.1 Procurement</h3>
                <p>Where we source and procure furniture, furnishings, and materials on your behalf, these items are purchased on your behalf and become your property upon delivery. We act as an agent, not a retailer.</p>
                <h3>7.2 Supplier Warranties</h3>
                <p>All furniture and materials carry the manufacturer's or supplier's warranty only. We are not liable for defects, damage during delivery by third-party couriers, or items not meeting expectations due to natural variations in colour or texture.</p>
                <h3>7.3 Rental Items</h3>
                <p>For property staging projects where furniture is rented, rental periods, terms, and returns are governed by the rental provider's agreement. Damage to or loss of rented items during the staging period is the Client's responsibility.</p>

                <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>All design concepts, mood boards, 3D visualisations, design plans, colour palettes, and creative materials produced by us remain our intellectual property until full payment is received. Upon full payment, you receive a licence to use the designs for the agreed property only.</p>
                <p>We retain the right to photograph completed projects and use images for our portfolio, website, social media, and marketing materials unless you explicitly request otherwise in writing before the project begins.</p>

                <h2>9. Liability &amp; Insurance</h2>
                <h3>9.1 Professional Indemnity</h3>
                <p>We carry professional indemnity insurance appropriate for the Services we provide. Our total liability for any claim arising from our Services is limited to the total value of the project fee paid.</p>
                <h3>9.2 Limitations</h3>
                <p>We are not liable for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pre-existing structural or maintenance issues with the property</li>
                    <li>Loss of rental income, sale proceeds, or other consequential losses</li>
                    <li>Delays caused by third-party suppliers, decorators, or tradespeople</li>
                    <li>Variations in paint colours, fabric shades, or material finishes compared to samples or digital representations</li>
                    <li>Any damage caused by the Client, tenants, guests, or third parties after project handover</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>10. Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>Where we coordinate or recommend third-party services (decorators, photographers, builders, cleaners), these parties operate under their own terms and conditions. We are not liable for the quality, timeliness, or conduct of third-party contractors, though we endeavour to work only with trusted professionals.</p>

                <h2>11. Complaints &amp; Disputes</h2>
                <p>We are committed to client satisfaction. If you are unhappy with any aspect of our Services, please contact us in writing within 7 days of project completion. We will endeavour to resolve any issues promptly and fairly.</p>
                <p>If a dispute cannot be resolved informally, both parties agree to attempt mediation before pursuing legal action. These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales, and the courts of England and Wales have exclusive jurisdiction.</p>

                <h2>12. Force Majeure</h2>
                <p>We are not liable for any failure or delay in performing our obligations where such failure or delay results from circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to: natural disasters, pandemics, government restrictions, supply chain disruptions, severe weather, or industrial action.</p>

                <h2>13. Data Protection</h2>
                <p>We collect and process personal data in accordance with our <a href="privacy.html" style="color: var(--color-blush-deep); text-decoration: underline;">Privacy Policy</a> and the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR). By engaging our Services, you consent to the collection and processing of your personal information as described therein.</p>

                <h2>14. Changes to These Terms</h2>
                <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. The version in force at the time of your booking will apply to your project. Material changes will be communicated to active clients in writing.</p>
